# Lessons

For new and upcoming programmers (freshmen/sophomores):

We're very happy that you are interested in competitive programming! Depening on need, afterschool lessons will be held once or twice a week. Information regarding the time and day will be posted on the Discord server.

For returning members (juniors/seniors):

Most of the things covered in these courses you will already be familiar with through AP Computer Science A and Computer Science 3, so if you need a refresher I would recommend looking over [rhscompsci/algorithms](https://github.com/rhscompsci/algorithms) rather than this repository.
